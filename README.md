Machine Learning Assignment - 3a

This assignment is to implement K_Means Clustering.

K_Means is an Unsupervised Learning Algorithm that can be used to classify data.
Here, the application is for Image Compression.

This code compresses the image and K value entered by user through the command line.

To execute the code:

python k_means.py <Input Image/Path> <K> <Output Image/Path>

Ex: python k_means.py Koala.jpg 5 Output.jpg
