# Machine-Learning

This repository contains different Machine Learning Algorithms implemented in python.

Each Algorithm is a separate branch.

Algorithms Implemented:
1. Decision Trees
2. Naive Bayes - Bag of Words and Bernoulli Models
3. Logistic Regression - Bag of Words and Bernoulli Models
4. K_Means Clustering
5. ScikitLearn Classifiers - SVM, MLP, Gradient Boosting
